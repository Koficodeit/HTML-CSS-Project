# Multi-Step Form Project

## **Description** 

This project showcases a *simple Info Card layout* designed using HTML and CSS. The layout is perfect for presenting information in a structured, visually appealing manner. Each card displays an image at the top, followed by a title and a short description, making it ideal for portfolios, blogs, or product showcases.

   - Styling the card elements (image, title, description) for visual balance.

### 3. **Suggested Enhancements**

## **Next Task**

`Cards`

1. `Advanced Level: Flip Card Effect`
