# Card Slider Project

## **Description** 

This project showcases a `Horizontal Card Slider` built using only HTML and CSS. The slider enables smooth transitions between cards and includes interactive navigation for switching between cards. Its design ensures responsiveness, allowing the cards to dynamically resize for different screen sizes.

## **Features**  

1. *Smooth Transitions*
   
   - Cards slide seamlessly into view on hover or navigation.

2. *Auto-Scrolling*
   
   -  Cards auto-scroll, with the feature commented out for easy disabling.

3. *Clickable Navigation*

   - Navigate between cards using arrows or dots.

4. *Fully Responsive Design*

   - Cards resize dynamically for various screen sizes.

## **What I Learned**  

### *1. HTML Structure*

   - Using correct semantics containers to group and structure cards.

   - Adding navigation controls (<label> elements) for dots.

   - Ensuring semantic and accessible markup for user interaction.

### 2. *CSS Styling*  

   - Using <Flexbox> to align cards horizontally within a container.

   - Implementing *overflow: hidden* to confine the cards within the slider.

   - Adding <transform> and <transition> properties for smooth sliding effects.

   - Styling navigation elements for easy interaction and aesthetic appeal.

   - Making the slider responsive with media queries.

### 3. **Suggested Enhancements** 

-  Adding JavaScript for advanced functionality like dynamic navigation and enhanced auto-scrolling.

-   Improving accessibility with keyboard controls and ARIA roles.

## **Current Limitations**

- The auto-scroll feature is disabled by default.

- No JavaScript support for more dynamic behavior (e.g., swipe gestures).
