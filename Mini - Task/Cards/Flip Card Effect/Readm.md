# Flip Card Effect

## **Description** 

This project demonstrates the creation of a flipping card using only HTML and CSS. The card flips on hover or click to reveal additional content on the back, offering a visually engaging way to present information. The design focuses on smooth animations and modern CSS techniques, providing an interactive user experience.

## **Features**  

1. *Dual-Sided Card*
   
   - `Front Side`: Displays an image and a title.

   - `Back Side`: Contains detailed information or a call-to-action button.

2. *Smooth Flip Animation*
   
   -  Utilizes CSS transitions for a seamless flipping effect. 

3. *Advanced CSS Techniques*

   - `Transform`: Enables the flipping motion.
   
   - `Perspective`: Adds depth to the 3D flip effect.
  
   - `Backface-Visibility`: Hides the back side when the front side is visible.

4. *Interactive Behavior*

   - Flips on hover enhancing user engagement.

## **What I Learned**  

### *1. HTML Structure*

   - Organizing the card using a wrapper <div> with nested child elements for the front and back sides.

   - Semantic usage of elements for clear separation of content.

### 2. *CSS Styling*  

   - Applying `transform: rotateY()` for the flipping motion.

   - Setting `perspective` on the parent element for depth.

   - Adding smoothness to the flip with transition properties.

   - Using backface-visibility: hidden to hide the opposite side during the flip.

   - Ensuring the card scales appropriately on different screen sizes.

   - Using backface-visibility: hidden to hide the opposite side during the flip.

### 3. **Suggested Enhancements** 

-  Next steps include adding JavaScript for better control over flipping behavior.

## **Current Limitations**

- Limited interactivity beyond hover effects.

## **How to Use This Project**

1. Clone or download the repository.

2. Open the <index.html> file in a modern browser to view the flipping card in action.
   
3. Customize the front and back content in the HTML as needed.

## **Next Task**

`Cards`

1. `Advanced Level: Flip Card Effect`

<Description>
Create a card that flips on hover or click to reveal additional content on the back. This project involves advanced CSS techniques like transform, perspective, and backface-visibility.

*Key Features:*
â€¢	Front side: Image and title.
â€¢	Back side: Detailed information or a call-to-action button.
â€¢	Smooth flipping animation using CSS transitions.


2. `Expert Level: Interactive Pricing Cards`

<Description>
Develop a set of pricing cards with hover effects to highlight the selected plan. Each card displays features, pricing, and a "Select Plan" button. Advanced animations and transitions should enhance interactivity.

*Key Features:*
â€¢	Responsive design for mobile and desktop views.
â€¢	Use animations to emphasize a hovered or active card.
â€¢	Include a badge or ribbon (e.g., "Most Popular") using pseudo-elements.


3. `Expert Level: Card Carousel`

<Description>
Design a horizontal card slider using only CSS. Cards should slide into view one by one with navigation arrows or dots for switching between cards. This project challenges CSS-only animation and layout skills.

*Key Features:*
â€¢	Implement smooth transitions between cards.
â€¢	Auto-scrolling feature or clickable navigation for switching.
â€¢	Fully responsive design with cards resizing dynamically.
