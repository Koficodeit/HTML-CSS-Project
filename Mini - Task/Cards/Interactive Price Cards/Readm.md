# Interactive Pricing Cards

## **Description** 

This project demonstrates the creation of Pricing Cards using only HTML and CSS. The cards provide a visually appealing way to showcase pricing plans and highlight user interactions with hover effects and transitions.

## **Features**  

1. *Hover Effects*
   
   - Smooth transitions using the scale property to highlight the selected card.

2. *Responsive Design*
   
   -  Designed for optimal viewing across mobile and desktop screens.

3. *Interactive Badge or Ribbon*

   - A dynamic ribbon appears on hover, created with CSS pseudo-elements (::after).

4. *Seamless Transitions*

   - Enhanced interactivity with CSS transitions for a smooth user experience.

## **What I Learned**  

### *1. HTML Structure*

   - Building card layouts with semantic tags for better organization and accessibility.

   - Using nested elements within each card for content such as titles, prices, and features.

### 2. *CSS Styling*  

   - Using Flexbox for card alignment and responsiveness.

   - Applying transition and *transform: scale* to emphasize hovered or active cards.

   - Creating ribbons using pseudo-elements (*::after*) to overlay custom labels.

   - Implementing media queries for responsiveness on various screen sizes.

### 3. **Suggested Enhancements** 

-  Improving accessibility by adding focus states for keyboard navigation.


---


## **Current Limitations**

- Lacks JavaScript functionality for dynamic interactions (e.g., plan selection).

- Ribbon animations could be further refined.

## **How to Use This Project**

1. Clone or download the repository.

2. Open the <index.html> file in a browser to view the pricing cards.
   
3. Customize the card content or styling directly in the HTML and CSS files.

## **Next Task**

`Cards`

1. `Expert Level: Card Carousel`

<Description>
Design a horizontal card slider using only CSS. Cards should slide into view one by one with navigation arrows or dots for switching between cards. This project challenges CSS-only animation and layout skills.

*Key Features:*
â€¢	Implement smooth transitions between cards.
â€¢	Auto-scrolling feature or clickable navigation for switching.
â€¢	Fully responsive design with cards resizing dynamically.
