# Carousel Image Gallery

## **Description** 

This project features a simple carousel-style gallery created entirely with HTML and CSS. The carousel allows users to view one image at a time and navigate through the gallery using buttons for "Previous" and "Next." The gallery is built using the *CSS Grid layout* for structure and animations for smooth transitions between images.

3. *Smooth Animations*

   - CSS animations create visually appealing transitions between images.

4. *Grid-Based Layout*

   - Using `CSS Grid` to align images and buttons efficiently.

   - Implementing animations for sliding transitions using <transform>.

   - Styling buttons for usability and a consistent design.

### 3. **Suggested Enhancements** 

-  Lazy loading images for faster performance on slower connections.

-  Adding responsiveness for optimal display on all screen sizes.

-  Adding responsiveness for optimal display on all screen sizes.

## **Next Task**

`Lightbox Image Gallery`

<Description>
Create a gallery where clicking on an image opens it in a full-screen overlay (lightbox effect). Use CSS pseudo-elements and transitions for the lightbox effect, and include a close button for exiting.

*Features*
    â€¢	Thumbnails displayed in a grid.
    
    â€¢	Full-size image overlay when a thumbnail is clicked.
    
    â€¢	Close button and background dimming using CSS overlays.

`Hover-Activated Slider Gallery`

<Description>
Design a gallery where hovering over a thumbnail dynamically changes the main displayed image. This can be done by using the :hover pseudo-class and CSS positioning to swap images.

*Features*
    â€¢	Main display area showing a larger version of the hovered thumbnail.
    
    â€¢	Thumbnail row below the main display.
    
    â€¢	Smooth transition effect when swapping images.
