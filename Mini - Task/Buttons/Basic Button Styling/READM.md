# Basic Button Styling

<Description>

This project showcases the creation of visually appealing and interactive buttons using HTML and CSS. The buttons come in different shapes, including square, rounded, and circular, and feature dynamic hover effects to enhance user engagement. Smooth animations, pulse effects, and text flipping provide a modern and professional feel to the design.




### <Features>
1. `Button Shapes` 
Square, Rectangle, Circular and Oval

2. `Animated Hover Effects` 
mooth size expansion or shrinkage and text flipping effects on hover. Subtle pulse and sliding animation for attracting attention. rephrase

3. `Dynamic Visual Appeal` 
Consistent and smooth transitions for all button states.




## **What I Learned**

1. ### `HTML Structure for Footer`
    .   Using semantic tags like <button> for clarity and accessibility.

2. ### `CSS Styling`

    .    Styling buttons with various <border-radius> values to achieve square, rounded, and circular shapes.

    .   Using <transition> for smooth hover effects.

    .   Applying pseudo-classes like *:hover* for interactivity.

3. ### `Enhancements to Consider`
    .   Adding responsive styles for buttons to fit different screen sizes.
    




## **Current Limitations**

    .   Buttons are not responsive for mobile-first designs.

    .   Limited functionality; animations are purely visual with no additional interactivity like toggles or clicks.

1. Clone or download the repository.
   
2. Open the <index.html> file in any modern web browser to view the hero section.
