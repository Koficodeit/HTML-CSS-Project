# Navigation Menu Project

<Description>
This project demonstrates the creation of a responsive Tab Navigation System using HTML and CSS. The design emphasizes accessibility, simplicity, and a unique approach by relying on radio inputs, labels, and Flexbox properties for layout and functionality.


### <Features>
1. Fully responsive tab navigation system for seamless content switching.
2. Tabs implemented using radio inputs and labels for a clean and accessible structure.
3. Flexbox properties for aligning tab content and ensuring responsiveness across various screen sizes.
4. No reliance on traditional <nav>, <ul>, <a>, or position properties, enabling a unique and modern design approach.


## **What I Learned**

1. ### `HTML Structure for Navigation`
    . Usage of the <nav> element.Using <input> elements with radio type to create selectable tabs.
    . Associating <label> elements with input to provide clickable tab interfaces.
    . Structuring tab content within corresponding <Semantics> elements for clear organization.

2. ### `CSS Styling`
    . Leveraging the :checked pseudo-class to toggle visibility and styles of tab content.
    . Aligning tabs and content using Flexbox for a responsive and visually appealing layout.
    . Adding smooth transitions to enhance user interaction.
    . Implementing responsive designs with media queries for various screen sizes.
    
3. ### `Enhancements to Consider`
    . Further refining animations for a smoother user experience.
    . Improved accessibility using ARIA roles.  (not implemented yet)
