# Navigation Menu Project

## **Description**

This project focuses on creating a vertical navigation menu using HTML and CSS. The goal was to develop a visually appealing and functional menu suitable for web applications or dashboards. The navigation bar is fixed, ensuring it remains visible while scrolling.

### <Features>
1. Vertical navigation bar for easy navigation in applications.
2. Hover effects to enhance user interaction with links and buttons.
3. A fixed navigation bar that remains visible while scrolling.
4. Smooth animations for hover and active states on navigation links and buttons.


## **What I Learned**

1. ### `HTML Structure for Navigation`
    . Usage of the <nav> element.
    . Structuring menu items with unordered lists (<ul> and <li>).
    . Incorporating anchor tags (<a>) for links.

2. ### `CSS Styling`
    . Styling the vertical navigation bar for a sleek look.
    . Adding hover effects and active states using transition and transform.
    . Utilizing position: fixed to create a sticky navigation bar.
    . Enhancing user interaction with smooth animations for buttons and links.
    
3. ### `Enhancements to Consider`
    . Implement smoother transitions for an enhanced user experience.
    . Improved accessibility using ARIA roles.  (not implemented yet)


## **How to Use This Project**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open index.html in any modern web browser to view the navigation menu.


## **Current Limitations**

The sidebar menu is fixed but not responsive, meaning it does not adapt well to smaller screen sizes.


## **Next Task**

`Responsive Sidebar Navigation`
    . Enhance the existing design to ensure the vertical navigation bar adapts seamlessly to all device sizes for web application and dashboards.
    . Create a collapsible sidebar that expands on hover or click (CSS-based).
