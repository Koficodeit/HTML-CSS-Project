# Navigation Menu Project

<Description>
This project demonstrates the creation of a Full-Screen Overlay Navigation system using HTML and CSS. The design focuses on providing an interactive, responsive menu that covers the entire screen when activated. It enhances user experience with intuitive toggle functionality, making it suitable for modern web designs.


### <Features>
1. Full-Screen Menu: Expands to cover the entire viewport when the hamburger icon is clicked.
   
2. Interactive Toggle: Utilizes the :checked pseudo-class with checkbox inputs to control the menu's visibility.
   
3. Modern Positioning: Employs CSS properties such as absolute and fixed for precise layout control.
   
4. Responsive Design: Optimized to work seamlessly on devices of various screen sizes.


## **What I Learned**

1. ### `HTML Structure for Navigation`
    .   Incorporated <input> and <label> for the hamburger and cancel icons, enabling interactive toggling without JavaScript.

    .   Structured the navigation links using semantic <ul> and <li> elements for accessibility.

2. ### `CSS Styling`
    .   Styled the overlay menu to occupy the entire screen using position: fixed.

    .   Implemented :checked pseudo-class to toggle visibility, ensuring a clean and modern user interaction.

    .   Designed responsive layouts with media queries to maintain usability across different devices.
    
3. ### `Enhancements to Consider`
    .   Adding smooth animations or transitions for opening and closing the menu.

    .   Improving hover and focus states for better interactivity.

    . Adding ARIA attributes for better screen reader support and accessibility (not implemented yet).


## **How to Use This Project**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open index.html in any modern web browser to view the navigation menu.
3. Click the hamburger icon to open the menu and the cancel icon to close it.


## **Current Limitations**
    .   No animations or transitions for menu toggling.


## **Next Task**
    .   Add animations for a smoother user experience.

`Mega Menu`
    . A large, dropdown menu with categorized links, suitable for e-commerce websites.
