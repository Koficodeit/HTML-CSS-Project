# Navigation Menu Project

<Description>
This project demonstrates the creation of a Mega Menu using HTML and CSS. A mega menu is an advanced navigation menu that provides a large dropdown interface, presenting links or content in categorized sections. This implementation focuses on usability, clarity, and seamless interaction. Currently, the menu is not responsive and is designed for desktop viewports.


### <Features>
1. Multi-Column Dropdown: Organized links into sections for better navigation.
   
2. Hover Interaction: The menu expands when hovering over the main navigation items.
   
3. Visually Distinct Categories: Groups of links are styled to enhance readability.
   
4. Smooth Animations: Added CSS transitions for hover effects.
   
5. Scalable Design: Easy to add or modify categories without restructuring the layout.


## **What I Learned**

1. ### `HTML Structure for Navigation`
    .   Organizing the navigation menu using ul and li elements.

    .   Nesting submenus within <semantics> containers to create dropdown categories.

2. ### `CSS Styling`
    .   Using `position: absolute, position: fixed and position: relative` to display dropdowns properly.

    .   Aligning dropdown sections using Flexbox for a structured layout.

    .   Applying `z-index` to ensure dropdowns overlay correctly.

    .   Creating hover effects with `:hover` pseudo-class for better user interaction.

    .   Adding CSS transitions for smooth opening and closing animations.
    
3. ### `Enhancements to Consider`
    .   Making the menu responsive for smaller screens using media queries.

    .   Adding keyboard accessibility with JavaScript for improved usability.

    . Adding ARIA attributes for better screen reader support and accessibility (not implemented yet).


## **How to Use This Project**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open index.html in any modern web browser to view the navigation menu.
3. Click the hamburger icon to open the menu and the cancel icon to close it.


## **Current Limitations**
    .   Not responsive for mobile or tablet screens.

    .   No JavaScript interaction (e.g., click-to-open functionality).


## **Next Task**
1. `Responsive Design`
.   Implement media queries for smaller screen sizes.
.   Convert the mega menu to a toggleable menu for mobile.

2. `Add JavaScript`
.   Enable dropdowns on click for better mobile usability.
.   Improve accessibility with keyboard navigation and ARIA roles.


## **Suggested Next Projects**
`Headers`
â€¢	Build a hero section with a heading, subheading, and a call-to-action button.

â€¢	Add a background image or gradient to the header.

â€¢	Make the header text animated (e.g., fading or sliding in).

â€¢	Create a responsive header with text and an image.



## **Technologies Used**

- `HTML`: Structured the mega menu using lists and containers.

- `CSS`: Styled the menu layout, hover effects, and animations.
