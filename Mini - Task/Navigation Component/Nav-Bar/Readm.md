# Navigation Menu Project

## **Description**

This project focuses on creating a navigation menu using HTML and CSS. The goal was to build a visually appealing and functional menu that could be used in websites or applications.

### <Features>
1. Horizontal navigation bar
2. Dropdown Sider bar functionality
3. Hover effects
4. Active state styling


## **What I Learned**

1. ### `HTML Structure for Navigation`
    . <nav> element usage
    . Unordered lists (<ul> and <li>) for menu items
    . Anchor tags (<a>) for links

2. ### `CSS Styling`
    . Flexbox for horizontal alignment
    . Styling hover and active states
    
3. ### `Enhancements to Consider`
    . Responsiveness for smaller screens (not implemented yet)
    . Improved accessibility using ARIA roles


## **How to Use This Project**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open index.html in any modern web browser.


## **Current Limitations**

1. Not Responsive: The navigation bar does not adjust for smaller screen sizes yet.
2. No Mobile Menu: A mobile-friendly hamburger menu is not included.


## **Next Task: Make the Navigation Menu Responsive**

### `Use Media Queries`
1. Add breakpoints to display Hamburger icon menu layout for smaller screens.
2. To toggle a dropdown menu when <hover> on Hamburger icon for the navigation items to display on smaller device.
