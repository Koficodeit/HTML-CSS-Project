# Navigation Menu Project

<Description>
This project demonstrates the creation of a responsive Breadcrumb Navigation system using HTML and CSS. The design focuses on creating a trail-style navigation menu that indicates the user's location within a website's hierarchy, helping improve user experience and accessibility.


### <Features>
1. Responsive breadcrumb navigation system that adapts to different screen sizes.
   
2. Breadcrumb links are structured using <nav> and <ol>, with the active class used to indicate the current page.
   
3. No reliance on complex JavaScript, providing a lightweight solution for page hierarchy navigation.
   
4. Simple, clean, and accessible HTML structure that works seamlessly across modern browsers.


## **What I Learned**

1. ### `HTML Structure for Navigation`
    . Using the <nav> element to define the breadcrumb navigation for accessibility.

    . Leveraging <ol> to create an ordered list, representing the trail of pages leading to the current page.

    . Adding the active class to the current pageâ€™s breadcrumb link to denote the userâ€™s current location.

2. ### `CSS Styling`
    . Styling breadcrumbs with a modern look, using margin, padding, and background colors for a clean design.

    . Enhancing the breadcrumb trailâ€™s usability by adding separators (`e.g., /`) between links using the :not(:last-of-type) selector.

    . Implementing media queries to ensure the breadcrumb navigation remains responsive and user-friendly on various screen sizes.
    
3. ### `Enhancements to Consider`
    . Improving animations or transitions when navigating between breadcrumbs.

    . Adding ARIA attributes for better screen reader support and accessibility (not implemented yet).


## **How to Use This Project**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open index.html in any modern web browser to view the navigation menu.


## **Current Limitations**
    . None! ðŸŽ‰ The breadcrumb navigation is fully functional, responsive, and accessible.


## **Next Task**

`Full-Screen Overlay Navigation`
    . A menu that takes up the entire screen when opened.



## **Suggested Next Projects**
Explore All Navigation Styles
Build examples of the following navigation styles:

1. `Mega Menu`
    . A large, dropdown menu with categorized links, suitable for e-commerce websites.
    
2. `Accordion Navigation`
   Collapsible navigation panels for compact designs.


## **Technologies Used**

- `HTML`: For structuring the breadcrumb navigation using <nav>, <ol>, and the active class.
- `CSS`: For styling and ensuring responsiveness using Flexbox and media queries.
