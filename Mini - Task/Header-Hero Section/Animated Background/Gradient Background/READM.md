# Hero Section with Shape Divider

<Description>

This project showcases a visually appealing Hero Section with a custom Shape Divider implemented using the CSS <clip-path> property. The shape divider adds a smooth curve between the hero section and the next content area, enhancing the aesthetic appeal of the web page. The current design focuses on creativity and style but is not yet responsive.




### <Features>
1. `Hero Section` 
A captivating header section designed to grab the user's attention.

2. `Custom Shape Divider` 
A curve created with the CSS clip-path property to separate the hero section from the rest of the page.
   
3. `Smooth Visual Flow`
The transition between sections is visually seamless.




## **What I Learned**

1. ### `HTML Structure for the Hero Section`
    .   Structuring the hero section with semantic tags like <header> for better readability.

2. ### `CSS Styling`
    .   Using the <clip-path> property to create custom curves and dividers.

    .   Styling the hero section with background colors and gradients for a professional appearance.

    .   Aligning content within the hero section using Flexbox for proper layout control.


3. ### `Enhancements to Consider`
    .   Making the shape divider and hero section responsive for different screen sizes.
    
    .   Adding animations to the shape divider for enhanced interactivity.

    .   Implementing media queries to make the design responsive on smaller screens.
    




## **Current Limitations**
    .   Not responsive for smaller screen sizes.
    
    .   Limited animations and interactivity beyond visual appeal.




## **How to Use This Project**

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the <index.html> file in any modern web browser to view the hero section.
3. Modify the hero section content or shape divider styles directly in the HTML and CSS files to customize the design.




## **Next Task**

`Animated Background`
    Add animations to the background using techniques such as:

      * Animated gradients.
      * Text animations.
      * Background image animations.




## **Suggested Next Projects**

1. `Responsive Background Design`
Ensure all background styles adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and colors.




## **Technologies Used**

- `HTML`: Structured the hero section and shape divider elements.

- `CSS`: Styled the hero section, created the shape divider using <clip-path>, and aligned content with Flexbox.
