## **What I Learned**

1. ### `HTML Structure for the Hero Section`
    .   Organizing the hero section using semantic HTML elements such as <header> and <section>.

    .   Incorporating animated text within the background using <span> and <div> elements.

    .   Structuring text and imagery for maximum visual impact.

2. ### `CSS Styling`
    .   Utilizing *@keyframes* and *transition / transform* for custom animations.

    .   Applying position properties to layer background text and hero content effectively.

    .   Styling animated text with gradients, shadows, and transformations for a modern look.
    
    .   Adding smooth transitions to enhance user experience.


3. ### `Enhancements to Consider`
    .   Making the shape divider and hero section responsive for different screen sizes.
    
    .   Experiment with additional animation types, such as background image animations.
    




## **Current Limitations**
    .   Not responsive for smaller screen sizes.
    
    .   No background image animations are currently implemented.
