# Hero Section with Overlay Gradient and Sticky Navigation

<Description>
This project showcases the implementation of a Hero Section with a smooth and visually appealing Full-Screen Video Background. The hero section enhances user engagement by replacing the static background with an immersive video, providing a dynamic and captivating first impression. This design utilizes various CSS properties like <position>, <transform>, and <z-index> for layering and alignment. Currently, the design is not responsive and is best suited for desktop screens.




### <Features>
1. `Full-Screen Video Background` 
Replaces the static background with a video, covering the full viewport for an immersive experience.

2. `Fixed Navigation Bar` 
Navigation bar positioned at the top with a consistent and fixed placement.
   
3. `Layered Positioning`
Used <relative>, <absolute>, and <fixed> positioning for precise control of elements.

4. `CSS Transform Property`
Applied to enhance layout alignment and smooth element positioning.

5. `Visually Engaging Design`
Video and content are overlaid for a clean and modern look.




## **What I Learned**

1. ### `HTML Structure for Hero Section`
    .   Adding a <video> element with attributes like <autoplay>, <loop>, and <muted> for a seamless background.

    .   Structuring the hero section content with semantic tags for clarity and accessibility.

    .   Layering content over the video using appropriate container elements.

2. ### `CSS Styling`
    .   Utilizing <position:-fixed> for the navigation bar and <position:-absolute> for content placement.

    .   Setting <z-index> values to layer the video, navigation, and text appropriately.

    .   Using <transform> for precise alignment of elements.

    .   Ensuring the video covers the viewport with <width:-100vw> and <height:-100vh>.

3. ### `Enhancements to Consider`
    .   Making the design responsive for smaller screens using media queries.
    




## **Current Limitations**
    .   The design is not responsive for mobile or tablet devices.
    
    .   Video playback may not work on older browsers or devices.




## **How to Use This Project**

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open <index.html> in a browser to view the current design.
3. Replace the video file <video.mp4> with your preferred background video in the <assets> folder.




## **Next Task**

`Parallax Scrolling Effect`
    Introduce a parallax effect for the background, adding depth and engagement.




## **Suggested Next Projects**

1. `Diagonal Background Section`
Experiment with slanted or diagonal background designs to create a unique visual appeal.

2. `Split Background with Two Colors`
Divide the hero section background into two contrasting colors for a bold and creative design.

3. `Animated Gradient Background`
Add motion to the gradient background for a dynamic and interactive experience.

4. `Header with Shape Divider`
Add a wave, curve, or custom shape divider between the hero section and the next content area.




## **Technologies Used**

- `HTML`: Structured the hero section and navigation bar.
