# Hero Section with Overlay Gradient and Sticky Navigation

<Description>
This project demonstrates the creation of a Hero Section with a visually appealing background image enhanced by an overlay gradient and descriptive text. The navigation menu is positioned at the top using the sticky property for consistent visibility during scrolling. Although currently not responsive, this design provides a strong foundation for building engaging and dynamic hero sections.




### <Features>
1. `Overlay Gradient on Background Image` 
Adds depth and focus to the hero section by blending a gradient over the image.

2. `Descriptive Text` 
Positioned on the hero section to capture attention with relevant messaging.
   
3. `Sticky Navigation Bar`
Ensures easy access to navigation links while scrolling.

4. `Positioning Techniques`
Utilized <relative> and <sticky> properties for precise layout control.

1. `Non-Responsive Design`
Primarily designed for desktop viewports; responsive improvements are planned for the future.

    .   Experimented with typography and text placement over background images.

    .   Enhanced visuals using gradients for a modern, professional look.

    .   Learned the importance of ensuring responsive design, which is a task for future iterations.




## **Current Limitations**
    .   The design is not responsive for mobile or tablet devices.
    
    .   No advanced effects like animations or videos are implemented yet.




## **How to Use This Project**

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open <index.html> in a browser to view the current design.

## **Next Task**

`Add a Full-Screen Video Background`
    Replace the static background with a full-screen video for an immersive experience.




## **Suggested Next Projects**
