# Header/Hero Background Section Project

<Description>
This project showcases the creation of a visually appealing Header/Hero Section with a focus on impactful color combinations for the background and text. The section is designed to grab attention and set the tone for the rest of the webpage. Currently, the design is not responsive and optimized for desktop viewports only.


### <Features>
1. **Bold Color Palette:** Eye-catching colors for the background and text to enhance visual appeal.
   
2. **Prominent Typography:** Styled text to create emphasis and deliver a strong message.
   
3. **Easy Customization:** Background and text colors can be easily modified for different themes.


## **What I Learned**

1. ### `HTML Structure for the Header`
    . Proper use of <header> tags for semantic clarity.

    . Structuring the hero content using <h1>, <p>, and optional <button> or <a> tags for calls to action.

2. ### `CSS Styling`
    . Applying background-color and color properties to enhance the visual appeal.

    . Centering text content using Flexbox for a clean and modern layout.

    . Adjusting font sizes and weights to create a visual hierarchy.

    . Using padding and margins to maintain spacing and alignment.
    
3. ### `Enhancements to Consider`
    .   Making the header responsive with media queries for smaller screen sizes.

    .   Adding hover effects or animations for text and buttons to increase interactivity.


## **How to Use This Project**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open index.html in any modern web browser to view the navigation menu.


## **Current Limitations**
