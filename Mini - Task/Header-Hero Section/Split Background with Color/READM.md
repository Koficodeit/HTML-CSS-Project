# Hero Section with Split Background

<Description>

This project focuses on creating a visually appealing hero section by dividing the background into two contrasting colors. The design offers a bold and creative approach, making the hero section stand out. While this version is not responsive, it demonstrates the effective use of color and layout in web design.




### <Features>
1. `Split Background` 
Divided the hero section into two contrasting colors for a modern and eye-catching design.

2. `Smooth Visual Appeal` 
Added gradients and seamless transitions to enhance the visual experience.
   
3. `Hero Section Layout`
Structured the header to emphasize key content and create a strong first impression.

4. `Creative Design`
Used CSS techniques to achieve a bold and unique aesthetic.




## **What I Learned**

1. ### `HTML Structure for the Hero Section`
    .   Organizing the hero section using semantic elements like <header> and <section>.

    .   Structuring content such as headings, subheadings, and call-to-action buttons within a hero layout.

2. ### `CSS Styling`
    .   Using *background: linear-gradient* and *background-color* to create split-color effects.

    .   Aligning text and buttons with Flexbox for a clean and professional look.

    .   Adding smooth transitions and hover effects to improve interactivity.

    .   Experimenting with color theory to ensure contrasting colors remain visually harmonious.


3. ### `Enhancements to Consider`
    .   Implementing media queries to make the design responsive on smaller screens.
    




## **Current Limitations**
    .   Not responsive for smaller screen sizes.
    
    .   Limited animations and interactivity beyond visual appeal.




## **How to Use This Project**

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the <index.html> file in any modern web browser to view the hero section.
3. Customize colors, text, and layout in the HTML and CSS files to suit your needs.




## **Next Task**

`Header with Shape Divider`
Add a wave, curve, or custom shape divider between the hero section and the next content area.




## **Suggested Next Projects**

1. `Animated Background`
Explore animation techniques for backgrounds to add motion to the gradient text and image animations for a dynamic and interactive experience.

2. `Responsive Background Design`
Ensure all background styles adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and colors.




## **Technologies Used**

- `HTML`: For structuring the hero section and overlay content.
- `CSS`: Styled the diagonal background, fixed attachments, and clip-path transitions.
