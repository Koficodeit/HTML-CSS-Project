# Simple Contact Form Project 

<Description>

This project showcases the creation of a simple Contact Form using HTML and CSS. The form includes fields for a user's full name, email, and message, as well as a submit button. While the form is not fully interactive, basic user engagement is enhanced with *:hover* and *:focus* pseudo-classes.




### <Features>
1. `User-Friendly Layout:` 

*   Includes input fields for full name and email.

*   A larger textarea for users to provide detailed messages.

*   A clearly labeled submit button for form submission.

2. `Hover Effects` 
Interactive *:hover* effects on the submit button and input fields for a modern feel.

3. `Focus State Styling:` 

*   Styled :focus states for input fields to guide user attention.




## **What I Learned**

1. ### `HTML Structure for Forms`
    .   Structuring form elements using the <form>, <input>, <textarea>, and <button> tags.

    .   Adding *type*, *placeholder*, and *name* attributes for functionality and accessibility.

2. ### `CSS Styling`

    .    Styling input fields and buttons to create a visually cohesive design.

    .   Using *:hover* to create interactive effects when users hover over elements.

    .   Using *:focus* to highlight active form fields for better usability.

    .   Aligning and spacing form elements with Flexbox.


3. ### `Enhancements to Consider`
    .   Adding validation to ensure proper data input (e.g., email format).
    
    .   Including a success or error message after submission.

    .   Implementing backend functionality to process form data.

    




## **Current Limitations**

.   No backend integration; form submissions are not processed.

.   Limited interactivity; no real-time validation or feedback.




## **How to Use This Project**

1. Clone or download the repository.

2. Open the <index.html> file in a browser to view the contact form.
   
3. Modify the placeholder text, labels, or styling directly in the HTML and CSS files as needed.




## **Next Task**

`Extra Challenges`

â€¢	Themed Forms: Style any form to match a specific theme (e.g., dark mode, minimalist, colorful).

â€¢	Animated Placeholder Form: Create a form where placeholders shift upwards or disappear when the user starts typing.

â€¢	Multi-Step Form (CSS Only): Divide a form into steps and use CSS to show one section at a time.




## **Technologies Used**

- `HTML`: Structured the form input with proper semantic elements.

- `CSS`: Styled the button :hover, and :focus effect effect.
