## **What I Learned**  

### *1. HTML Structure*

-   Created form fields using semantic HTML elements like <input>, <textarea>, and <button>.

-   Added required and pattern attributes to enable browser-based validation.  

-   Used the <label> element for accessibility and linking labels to inputs.

### 2. *CSS Styling*  

-   Styled form elements for a cohesive and modern design.

-   SCustomized the file input with *::file-selector-button* for better appearance.

-   Used Font Awesome icons to enhance the visual feedback.  

-   Applied CSS pseudo-classes like *:hover*, *:focus*, *:invalid*, and *:valid* for interactivity.

### 3. *User Engagement Enhancements*

* Improved user experience through hover and focus effects.

* Added visual feedback for valid and invalid input states.

* Improve the accessibility of the input file with JavaScript to be able to upload files.

## **Current Limitations**

-   Form submission functionality is not implemented (backend required).
  
-   The input file type dose not show or indicate when files are been uploaded to the page.
  
-   Uses external library such as Font Awesome Icons for visual display therefore internet is needed to display the Icons
