## **What I Learned**  

### *1. HTML Structure*

   - Creating form fields using <input>, <textarea>, <select>, and <button> elements. 

   - Using <fieldset> and <legend> to group related inputs.  

   - Associating <label> elements with inputs for better accessibility.

   - Implementing validation attributes such as *required*, *pattern*, and *type*.  

### 2. *CSS Styling and Interactivity*  

   - Styling form elements (e.g., checkboxes, radio buttons) for a polished look.

   - Using Flexbox to align checkboxes and radio buttons neatly.

   - Applying `:hover` and `:focus` states for interactive feedback.  

   - Utilizing `:invalid` and `:valid` pseudo-classes for real-time validation effects.

   - Ensuring consistent spacing and alignment for a professional appearance.

### 3. *User Engagement Enhancements*

* Providing visual cues for validation states (e.g., highlighting invalid inputs).

* Ensuring hover effects and focus states are intuitive and visually appealing.

## **Current Limitations**

- No backend integration for form submission.
  
- Validation relies solely on HTML attributes; advanced validation requires JavaScript.

## **How to Use This Project**

1. Clone or download the repository.

2. Open the <index.html> file in a browser to interact with the survey form.
   
3. Fill in the form fields and submit to test validation states and interactivity.

## **Next Task**

1.	Reservation Form

2.	Job Application Form

3.	Search Form with Filters

4.	Payment Form

`Extra Challenges`

â€¢	Themed Forms: Style any form to match a specific theme (e.g., dark mode, minimalist, colorful).

â€¢	Animated Placeholder Form: Create a form where placeholders shift upwards or disappear when the user starts typing.

â€¢	Multi-Step Form (CSS Only): Divide a form into steps and use CSS to show one section at a time.




## **Technologies Used**

- `HTML`: Structured the form structure with inputs, labels, and validation attributes.

- `CSS`: Styled the form, added interactivity, and ensured responsive design using Flexbox.
