## **Current Limitations**

- No backend integration for form submission.
  
- Validation relies solely on HTML attributes; advanced validation requires JavaScript.

## **How to Use This Project**

1. Clone or download the repository.

2. Open the <index.html> file in a browser to interact with the survey form.
   
3. Modify the categories, placeholders, or range values directly in the HTML for customization.

`Extra Challenges`

â€¢	Themed Forms: Style any form to match a specific theme (e.g., dark mode, minimalist, colorful).

â€¢	Animated Placeholder Form: Create a form where placeholders shift upwards or disappear when the user starts typing.

â€¢	Multi-Step Form (CSS Only): Divide a form into steps and use CSS to show one section at a time.




## **Technologies Used**

- `HTML`: Structured the form structure with inputs, labels, and validation attributes.

- `CSS`: Styled the form, added interactivity, and ensured responsive design using Flexbox.

- `Font Awesome`: Added icons for input fields and buttons
