## **What I Learned**  

### *1. HTML Structure*

   - Using `aria-label` for descriptive labeling of input fields.

   - Including `aria-required` to ensure required fields are identified for assistive technologies.

   - Structuring forms with proper semantic elements for clarity.

### 2. *CSS Styling*  

   - Implementing *dark mode styles* with consistent color schemes.

   - Styling input fields with icons using Font Awesome.

   - Utilizing `:focus`, `:hover`, `:valid`, and `:invalid` pseudo-classes to indicate user interactions and validation states.  

   - Adding smooth transitions for hover and focus effects.

### 3. **Suggested Enhancements** 

- Implement JavaScript for dynamic form validation and user feedback.  

- Adding more ARIA roles for enhanced accessibility.  

- Providing user-friendly error messages using tooltips or inline messages.  


---


## **Current Limitations**

- No backend integration for form submission.
  
- Validation is limited to HTML and CSS; advanced checks (e.g., Luhn Algorithm for card numbers) are not implemented.
  
- Used an external library, such as Font Awesome therefore an internet connection is require to display the icon the page.

## **Next Task**

`Extra Challenges`

â€¢	Animated Placeholder Form: Create a form where placeholders shift upwards or disappear when the user starts typing.

â€¢	Multi-Step Form (CSS Only): Divide a form into steps and use CSS to show one section at a time.

## **Technologies Used**

- `HTML`: Structured the form structure with inputs, labels, and validation attributes.

- `CSS`: Styled the form, added interactivity, and ensured responsive design using Flexbox.

- `Font Awesome`: Added icons for input fields and buttons
