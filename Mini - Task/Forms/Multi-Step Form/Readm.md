# Animated Placeholder Form

## **Description** 

This project showcases the creation of an Animated Placeholder Form, a user-friendly and interactive form where placeholders dynamically shift upwards or disappear as the user starts typing. The form incorporates proper HTML input validation and adheres to accessibility standards with the use of <aria-label> and <aria-required> attributes. Enhanced visual feedback is provided with hover, focus, transform, and transition effects for improved user engagement.

## **What I Learned**  

### *1. HTML Structure*

   - Using <aria-label> to provide descriptive labels for assistive technologies.

   - Applying <aria-required> for clear indication of mandatory fields.

   - Structuring forms to be semantic and accessible to screen readers.

### 2. *CSS Styling*  

   - Implementing `:focus`, `:hover`, and :valid pseudo-classes to style form elements dynamically.

   - Using `transform` and `transition` to create smooth animations for placeholders.

### 3. **Suggested Enhancements** 

- Implement JavaScript for dynamic form validation and user feedback.  

- Ensuring animations improve user experience without disrupting form usability.
