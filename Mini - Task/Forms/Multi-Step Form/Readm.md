# Multi-Step Form Project

## **Description** 

This project demonstrates the creation of a Multi-Step Form using only HTML and CSS. The form is divided into multiple steps, with each step displayed one at a time. The design includes proper input validation and interactive visual effects to enhance user engagement and usability.

3. *Interactive Styling*

   - Added `:hover`, `:focus`, and `:valid` pseudo-classes to provide visual feedback. 

4. *CSS Transitions and Transforms*

   - Smooth animations for form navigation and validation states.

5. *User-Friendly Design*

## **What I Learned**  

### *1. HTML Structure*

   - Leveraging HTML5 validation attributes like `required`, `pattern`, and `type`.

   - Using buttons with `type="button`" and `type="submit`" for navigation and submission.

### 2. *CSS Styling*  

   - Controlling the visibility of form steps using `:nth-of-type`, `:checked`, and sibling combinators.

   - Applying transitions and transforms for smooth navigation between steps.

   - Adding hover and focus effects to highlight active input fields.

   - Customizing `:valid` and `:invalid` states to visually indicate input validity.

### 3. **Suggested Enhancements** 

- Implement JavaScript for dynamic form validation and user feedback.  

- Ensuring animations improve user experience without disrupting form usability.

## **Current Limitations**

- Does not support saving form data between steps (requires JavaScript or backend integration).
  
- Not optimized for smaller screen sizes (can be improved with responsive design).

## **How to Use This Project**

1. Clone or download the repository.

2. Open <index.html> in any modern browser to view the animated placeholder form.
   
3. Navigate through the form steps and test the validation functionality.

## **Next Task**

`Cards`

â€¢	Cards help organize content and apply hover effects.
    
    o	Build a basic card with an image, title, and description.
    
    o	Add hover effects for zoom-in or elevation.
    
    o	Create a responsive card layout using Flexbox or Grid.
