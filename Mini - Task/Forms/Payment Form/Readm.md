# Payment Form Project 

## **Description** 

This project showcases a professionally designed Payment Form built with proper HTML input validation, enhanced accessibility, and interactive visual feedback. The form adheres to best practices in web development by incorporating `aria-label` and `aria-required` attributes for improved accessibility. It also features a clean and modern design, utilizing icons and interactive states to ensure a smooth user experience.

## **What I Learned**  

### *1. HTML Structure*

   - Structuring a payment form with semantic HTML elements. 

   - Adding `aria-label` and `aria-required` attributes for better accessibility.  

   - Using `pattern` and `required` attributes to validate inputs (e.g., regex for card number and CVV). 

### 2. *CSS Styling*  

   - Styling inputs with icons using Font Awesome and pseudo-elements.

   - Implementing validation states with `:valid` and `:focus` pseudo-classes.

   - Creating hover and focus effects for user interaction.  

   - Designing a responsive layout that adapts to various screen sizes.

### 3. **Suggested Enhancements** 

- Implement JavaScript for dynamic form validation and user feedback.

## **Current Limitations**

- No backend integration for form submission.
  
- Validation is limited to HTML and CSS; advanced checks (e.g., Luhn Algorithm for card numbers) are not implemented.
  
- Used an external library, such as Font Awesome therefore an internet connection is require to display the icon the page.

## **Next Task**

1.	Payment Form

`Extra Challenges`

â€¢	Themed Forms: Style any form to match a specific theme (e.g., dark mode, minimalist, colorful).

â€¢	Animated Placeholder Form: Create a form where placeholders shift upwards or disappear when the user starts typing.

â€¢	Multi-Step Form (CSS Only): Divide a form into steps and use CSS to show one section at a time.

## **Technologies Used**

- `HTML`: Structured the form structure with inputs, labels, and validation attributes.

- `CSS`: Styled the form, added interactivity, and ensured responsive design using Flexbox.

- `Font Awesome`: Added icons for input fields and buttons
