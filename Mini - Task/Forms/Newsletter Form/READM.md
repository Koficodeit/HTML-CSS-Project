   - Usage of the `fieldset` and `legend` elements for form grouping.  
   - Creating input fields for user data collection.  
   - Adding checkboxes for user preferences or consent.  

### *2. CSS Styling and Interactivity*  

    - Styling buttons and inputs for a modern look.  
   - Enhancing user experience with pseudo-classes:  
      - *`:hover`*: Highlighting buttons and inputs on mouse hover.

## **Current Limitations**

`Extra Challenges`

â€¢	Themed Forms: Style any form to match a specific theme (e.g., dark mode, minimalist, colorful).

â€¢	Animated Placeholder Form: Create a form where placeholders shift upwards or disappear when the user starts typing.

â€¢	Multi-Step Form (CSS Only): Divide a form into steps and use CSS to show one section at a time.




## **Technologies Used**

- `HTML`: Structured the form input with proper semantic elements.

- `CSS`: Styled the button :hover effect and pseudo-class implementations..
