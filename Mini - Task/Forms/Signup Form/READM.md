## **Features**  

1. *Input Validation*
   
   - `Pattern Matching:` Ensures inputs conform to specified formats.  

   - `Minlength Validation:` Enforces minimum character requirements for fields.  

   - `Required Fields:` Critical fields are mandatory for submission. 

2. *Interactive Styling*
   
   - `:hover`: Visual feedback when hovering over input fields or buttons.  


   - :focus`: Highlights active input fields for better usability. 


   - `:invalid`: Indicates errors in user input with styling cues.  


   - `:valid`: Confirms correct input with positive feedback.  

3. *Accessibility Enhancement*

*  Autocomplete attributes for faster form filling.

*  Clear checkbox selection for terms and conditions.

## **What I Learned**  

### *1. HTML Structure*

   - Using `pattern` attributes to define regex for input validation. 

   - Implementing `minlength` and `required` attributes for better data integrity.  

   - Utilizing `autocomplete` to streamline user input. 

   - Structuring form elements with labels and inputs for accessibility.  

### 2. *CSS Styling and Interactivity*  

   - Leveraging `:hover` and `:focus` pseudo-classes to provide feedback.

   - Styling `:invalid` and `:valid` states for real-time validation.

   - Creating transitions for smooth hover and focus effects.  

   - Ensuring form elements are visually consistent across devices.

### 3. *Basic Validation*

* Leveraging HTML5 input attributes such as required and type="email" to enforce input validation.

## **Current Limitations**

- Validation is entirely client-side; no server-side validation is implemented.
  
- The form may not be fully optimized for older browsers.


---


## **How to Use This Project**

1. Clone or download the repository.

2. Open the index.html file in a browser to view and interact with the form.
   
3. Fill out the form and observe validation feedback and hover effects.  


---


## **Suggested Enhancements** 

- Implement JavaScript for dynamic form validation and user feedback.

## **Next Task**

1.	Survey Form

2.	Reservation Form

3.	Job Application Form

4.	Search Form with Filters

5.	Payment Form

`Extra Challenges`

â€¢	Themed Forms: Style any form to match a specific theme (e.g., dark mode, minimalist, colorful).

â€¢	Animated Placeholder Form: Create a form where placeholders shift upwards or disappear when the user starts typing.

â€¢	Multi-Step Form (CSS Only): Divide a form into steps and use CSS to show one section at a time.




## **Technologies Used**

- `HTML`: Structured the form structure with inputs, labels, and validation attributes.

- `CSS`: Styled the form, validation states, and interactive effects.
