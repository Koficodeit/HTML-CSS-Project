-   Associating <label> elements with inputs for better accessibility.

### 2. *CSS Styling*

-   Styling and aligning the date picker for a modern design.

-   Using pseudo-classes like :hover, :focus, :invalid, and :valid to manage form state styles.

* Ensuring hover effects and focus states are intuitive and visually appealing.

## **Current Limitations**
