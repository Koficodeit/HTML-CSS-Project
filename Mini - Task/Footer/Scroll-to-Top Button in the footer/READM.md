## **What I Learned**

1. ### `HTML Structure for Footer`
    .   Using semantic tags like <footer> for clarity and accessibility.

    .   Organizing content into visually distinct columns for better navigation.

    .   Implementing forms, accordions, and navigation menus within a single footer.

2. ### `CSS Styling`

    .    Creating a scroll-to-top button using *position: fixed*, *visibility*, and *animations*.

    .   Adding hover effects with *:hover* pseudo-class for links and icons.

    .   Designing collapsible accordion menus using the *:hover* and *:checked* pseudo-classes.

    .   Aligning multi-column layouts with Flexbox for consistency and responsiveness.

    .   Adding media queries for smaller screen sizes to make the footer fully responsive.

    .   Styling form elements and buttons for a user-friendly and aesthetic interface.

3. ### `Enhancements to Consider`
    .   Smooth animations for buttons, accordions, and hover effects.

    .   Interactive social media icons with scaling and color transitions.

    .   Added a responsive navigation menu that collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.
    




## **Current Limitations**

    .   The project uses external plibraries such as Font Awesome so an internet connection is needed for the `icons` to display unless hosted locally.

    .   Forms are static; they do not currently process data.

    .   Accordion menus do not have JavaScript for advanced functionality (e.g., remembering state).
