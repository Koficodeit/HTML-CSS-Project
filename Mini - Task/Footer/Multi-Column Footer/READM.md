## **What I Learned**

1. ### `HTML Structure for Footer`
    .   Organizing a footer with semantic <footer> and <section> tags for accessibility.

    .   Using nested <ul> and <li> elements to create organized lists for links and info.

    .   Embedding a simple *form* for newsletter sign-up functionality.

2. ### `CSS Styling`

    .    Designing a multi-column layout using Flexbox for easy alignment.

    .   Adding hover effects with *:hover* pseudo-class for links and icons.

    .   Applying *transform: rotate* and *transition* to social media icons for dynamic animations.

    .   Ensuring responsiveness with media queries, making the footer adapt to smaller screens.

    .   Using *position: fixed* to keep the footer static at the bottom of the viewport

3. ### `Enhancements to Consider`
    .   Integrate scroll-triggered animations for a more immersive experience.
    




## **Current Limitations**
    .   The project uses external plibraries such as Font Awesome so an internet connection is needed for the `icons` to display unless hosted locally.

1. Clone or download the repository.
   
2. Open the <index.html> file in any modern web browser to view the hero section.
