# Basic Footer Section Project

<Description>

This project implements a *visually appealing and functional footer section* using HTML and CSS. The footer design emphasizes simplicity, accessibility, and dynamic user engagement with hover effects and responsive behavior. It includes contact information, copyright notice, and social media icons styled with hover animations. The footer is designed to be *fixed at the bottom* for consistent visibility and incorporates a responsive layout for seamless user experience across devices.




### <Features>
1. `Simple and Informative Design` 
Includes essential elements like contact information and copyright notice.

2. `Dynamic Social Media Icons` 
Rotating effects added to icons using *transform: rotate()* for user engagement.

3. `Interactive Hover Effects` 
Links and icons change appearance on hover to provide visual feedback to users.

4. `Fixed Positioning`
The footer remains fixed at the bottom of the viewport for consistent visibility.

1. `Responsive Design`
Automatically adjusts layout for various screen sizes using media queries.





## **What I Learned**

1. ### `HTML Structure for Footer`
    .   Using <footer> tags for semantic markup.

    .   Structuring elements like contact info and social media by using HTML semantics for better organization.

    .   Adding <a> tags to make icons and links interactive.

    


2. ### `CSS Styling`

    .    Used *position: fixed* to keep the footer visible at the bottom of the page.

    .   Applied *:hover* pseudo-class to create engaging animations for links and icons.

    .   Added *transform: rotate()* to social media icons for visual appeal.

    .   Used Flexbox for aligning elements horizontally and vertically.

    .   Incorporated media queries to adjust spacing, font sizes, and icon arrangement on smaller screens.

3. ### `Enhancements to Consider`
    .   Integrate scroll-triggered animations for a more immersive experience.
    




## **Current Limitations**
    .   

    .   The project uses external plibraries such as Font Awesome so an internet connection is needed for the `icons` to display unless hosted locally.
